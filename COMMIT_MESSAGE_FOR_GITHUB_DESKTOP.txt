feat: Complete MedSecure Vision implementation

Initial implementation of HIPAA-compliant biometric authentication system:

Core Components:
- WPF client with face recognition UI and presence monitoring
- Python face service (MediaPipe BlazeFace + InsightFace ArcFace)
- ASP.NET Core 8 backend API with Auth0 integration
- React admin console for user and policy management

Features:
- Real-time face detection and recognition (sub-500ms authentication)
- Continuous presence monitoring with automatic session locking
- Face enrollment with multi-angle capture and quality validation
- Liveness detection (blink, head movement) for anti-spoofing
- AES-256-GCM encryption for face templates
- HIPAA-compliant audit logging system
- Fallback authentication (PIN, Windows Hello, Smart Card)

Testing:
- Comprehensive unit test suite (xUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq)
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Tests for encryption, face verification, and audit logging

Documentation:
- User guide for end users
- Administrator guide for system admins
- Developer guide for contributors
- API reference documentation
- HIPAA compliance documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
